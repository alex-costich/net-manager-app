# TRIGGER WARNING ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨
# I built this with basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS and used React for the sake of using it (React code here is shameful)
# I also didn't take the time to learn git.

If you want to see some good React code, please visit my other repos.
- I am very sorry.
- I very much regret not taking the time to read the docs or take a course.
- I actually took an intensive React course after because I felt so bad.
- I know git now too.
- Sorry again!
